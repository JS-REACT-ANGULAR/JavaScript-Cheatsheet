//1 - Memory Efficient

//In the example below, every time we use heavyDuty1(). A new Array is created and destroyed. Bad for Memory
function heavyDuty1(index) {
    const bigArray = new Array(7000).fill("Hi");
    console.log("Created");
    return bigArray[index];
}

heavyDuty1(100); //Array is created and destryed
heavyDuty1(200); //Array is created and destryed
heavyDuty1(300); //Array is created and destryed


//While in case of heavyDuty2(), array is created only once with heavyDuty2() call. All because of Closure
function heavyDuty2() {
    const bigArray = new Array(7000).fill("Hi");
    console.log("Created");
    return function getIndex(index) {
        return bigArray[index];
    }
}

const getHeavyDuty2 = heavyDuty2(); ////Array is created only once here
getHeavyDuty2(100); //Already created Array is accessed using closure
getHeavyDuty2(200); //Already created Array is accessed using closure
getHeavyDuty2(300); //Already created Array is accessed using closure
