//Every function in JS file has it's own EXECUTION CONTEXT
//Before even that Every JS File starts with GLOBAL execution Context
//Global Execution Context starts with a global variable WINDOWS (GLOBAL with node) and THIS
//Every Execution context has 2 parts. Creation Phase and Execution Phase
//Creation Phase is where hoisting happens
//Execution Phase then runs code.

var myName = "Devesh K"

function getMyName() {
    console.log(myName)
    var myName = "Devesh Kumar"
    return myName;
}

function findMyName() {
    return getMyName();
}

function printMyName() {
    console.log(findMyName());
}

printMyName();

//In the example above 5 execution context are created

//Global
//printMyName
//findMyName
//getMyName
