//Every function in JS file has it's own EXECUTION CONTEXT
//Before even that Every JS File starts with GLOBAL execution Context
//Global Execution Context starts with a global variable WINDOWS (GLOBAL with node) and THIS
//Every Execution context has 2 parts. Creation Phase and Execution Phase
//Creation Phase is where hoisting happens
//Execution Phase then runs code.

var myName = "Devesh"

function getMyName() {
    console.log(myName); //undefined //Why because here myName is not coming from global but getMyName Execution context. Where myName is hoisted with value undefined
    var myName = "Devesh Kumar";
    return myName;
}

function findMyName() {
    console.log("Printing: " + myName); //Printing: Devesh
    return getMyName();
}

function printMyName() {
    console.log(findMyName()); //Devesh Kumar
}

printMyName(); //Devesh Kumar

//In the example above 5 execution context are created

//Global
//printMyName
//findMyName
//getMyName
